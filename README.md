# XKtools
My personal tool to manage F&amp;O environments
It was created based on my personal needs using scripts created with the help of ChatGPT!
Every single line in any of the scripts was created using ChatGPT, I just change some things to adapt to my daily work. always using ChatGPT!
Run the "00 - Menu.ps1" file to have access to different options. I believe that the name of the scripts a very clear and gives you a tip about what it executes.
I will make changes based on the issues or different needs i find during its execution.
Some of the scripts uses the D365FO.Tools to run D365F&O administrative tasks like Build, Sync DB or cleanup tables before to restore a .bacpac file.
With more time I will add a description for each script.
Hope it helps me save some time, if It helps you too, awesome!
